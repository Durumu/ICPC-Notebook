\section{The Skeleton}
    \subsubsection*{The Mother Program}
        Every C++ program should begin with this.
        The \code{\#include} statement will bring in the entire C++11 STL when compiled with \code{g++}, and the strange I/O statements will prevent standard IO from syncing with each other. This will speed up a program that reads from stdout/stdin substantially, at the cost of making \code{scanf} and \code{printf} completely unusable, so use only if you plan on using purely \code{cin} and \code{cout}.

    \subsubsection*{Makefile}
    To compile programs, use the following makefile, which incorporates the exact command used by the judges:
    \begin{cpp}
    main: main.cpp
        g++ -g -lm -lcrypt -O2 -std=c++11 main.cpp -o main
    clean:
        rm main
    \end{cpp}

\subsection{Defines}
    The following \code{\#define}s are \textit{assumed} to be present for every code snippet in this entire notebook, but not all must be typed out for every problem.
    \begin{cpp}
        #define LSB(i) ((i) & (-i))
        #define mid(a,b) ((a) + ((b)-(a))/2)
    \end{cpp}
